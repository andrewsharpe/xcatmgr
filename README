xCATmgr is a utility to help manage clusters managed by xCAT (http://xcat.sourceforge.net).	It is a simple Tkinter application that uses xcat commands (not tab files) to display a representation of an xCAT managed cluster and allows you to perform simple operations on nodes

If you're not running this on your management node (xCAT) then you'll need ssh keys hooked up to login to your management node without requiring a password.  You might want to checkout keychain for assistance with this.

To start, copy xcatmgr.ini to ~/.xcatmgr.ini and edit it appropriately.  The example config file contains information on what's allowed/required in it.

To run the tool (after easy_installing it), just run
	xCATmgr.py
